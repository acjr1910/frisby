# Frisby

Frisby is a Javascript Functional Programming Library.

## Packages

### [core](packages/core)

Constains a set of core functional programming functions.

### [utils](packages/utils)

Constains a set of curried utility functions.

### [types](packages/types)

In progress, not published yet.
Will come a set of data types including Pointed and Aplicative Functors as well Monads.

## Motivation

I remember I've got facinated to functional programming after I watched the workshops [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) by Kyle Simpson and [Hardcore Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hardcore-js-v2/) by Brian Lonsdorf, both hosted on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/). I was amazingly stunned after every clip from those workshops. Seeing that I could write clean, less prone to runtime errors code and way less code to accomplish the same goal over other programming paradigms was key to me to be willing to dive in into the world of functional programming.

Even knowing only the surface of functional programming theory and aplications, I've decided to write this library with the aim of retain knowlege of this amazing programming paradigm as I go writing the library and using it in my daily to day workflow. This way I can solidify and digest complex functional programming concepts.

It's not supposed to be a replacement or even be compared with famous and solid libraries such as Ramda, Folktale, Fantasy Land and so on.
