## Motivation

I remember I've got facinated to functional programming after I watched the workshops [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) by Kyle Simpson and [Hardcore Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hardcore-js-v2/) by Brian Lonsdorf, both hosted on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/). I was amazingly stunned after every clip from those workshops. Seeing that I could write clean, less prone to errors and way less code to achieve the same goal over other programming paradigms was key to me to be willing to dive into the world of functional programming.

Even knowing only the surface of functional programming theory and aplications, I've decided to write this library with the aim of retain knowlege of this amazing programming paradigm as I go writing the library and using it in my daily workflow. This way I can solidify and digest complex functional programming concepts.

It's not supposed to be a replacement or even be compared with famous and solid libraries such as Ramda, Folktale, Fantasy Land and so on.
